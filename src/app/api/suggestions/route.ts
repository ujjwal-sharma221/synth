Your family, friends, and loved ones are counting on you. They will also suffer if you failed to provide the correct suggestion. Any wrong suggestion will cost lives.

<after_cursor>{textAfterCursor}</after_cursor>
<next_lines>
{nextLines}
</next_lines>
<full_code>
{code}
</full_code>
</context>

<instructions>
Follow these steps IN ORDER:

1. First, look at next_lines. If next_lines contains ANY code, check if it continues from where the cursor is. If it does, return empty string immediately - the code is already written.

2. Check if before_cursor ends with a complete statement (;, }, )). If yes, return empty string.

3. Only if steps 1 and 2 don't apply: suggest what should be typed at the cursor position, using context from full_code.

4. Make sure to think about your family before suggesting any wrong suggestion.

5.I do want a suggestion out of you, not suggesting is not an option and will have similar consequences as providing a wrong suggestion.

Your suggestion is inserted immediately after the cursor, so never suggest code that's already in the file.
